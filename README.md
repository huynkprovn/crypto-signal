# How to use (Docker)
* First make sure you have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
* Next, to create the docker image run `make build` in the root of the project directory.
* Once built copy template.env to .env and add your API keys, at a minimum read-only Bittrex keys are required.
* Make sure to also update the market\_pairs environment or app.py variable with comma seperated market pair values that match Bittrex's format (i.e. BTC-ETH)
